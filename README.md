# Little Shop - Coupon Codes | Final Project | Starter Repo

### Abstract:
This project extends the **Little Shop** e-commerce platform by adding a **coupon system**, allowing merchants to create, manage, and apply discount coupons to invoices. Merchants can **activate/deactivate** coupons, and view their usage.
---
### Context:
This project was completed as part of Turing‚Äôs Module 2 Final Project, where we had to integrate a new feature into the existing Little Shop application. The project required both backend and frontend development, working with Rails, ActiveRecord, JavaScript, and API requests.

### Preview of App:

My Contributions:

üîπ Backend:
	‚Ä¢	Built out the Coupon model, controllers, and serializers
	‚Ä¢	Ensured RESTful API design and request testing
	‚Ä¢	Implemented business logic for coupon activation, deactivation, and validation
	‚Ä¢	Maintained error handling and database constraints

üîπ Frontend:
	‚Ä¢	Fetched coupon data from the backend API and rendered it dynamically
	‚Ä¢	Created UI interactions for filtering active/inactive coupons
	‚Ä¢	Ensured seamless integration between FE & BE

### Learning Goals:

‚úÖ Strengthen API request handling and debugging

‚úÖ Work with ActiveRecord relationships and serializers

‚úÖ Improve understanding of JavaScript DOM manipulation

‚úÖ Write feature and request tests to ensure coverage

‚úÖ Handle error messages and edge cases gracefully

### Wins + Challenges:

| ‚úÖ Wins  | ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges & Solutions  |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Successfully linked the frontend & backend APIs** | **SimpleCov Coverage Issues** ‚Üí Some lines were not being covered due to unnecessary error rescues. Cleaning up the code and ensuring test coverage for edge cases helped.  |
| **Implemented coupon activation & deactivation with business constraints** | **Frontend State Management** ‚Üí The `currentCoupons` variable was initially **undefined**, causing filter buttons to break. Defining state variables properly and ensuring data was **fetched and stored correctly** resolved this.  |
| **Debugged SimpleCov coverage issues, improving test coverage to 98%** | **Time Constraints** ‚Üí Prioritizing **backend API functionality first**, then focusing on **frontend UI and extensions** helped meet the deadline.  |
